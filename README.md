This is just a simple mod that changes up desktop Stardew Valley's controls to match the controls on the Switch version, for those of us who originally played the game on Switch and don't particularly feel like rewiring their muscle memory.

It works better than just using something like Steam or another app to switch the A and B buttons on your controller, because with this mod the controls will still work properly when playing "Journey of the Prairie King". It also helps in those situations where there's no way to change up the controller mapping anyway. (I'm looking at you and your non-functional "Game Controller" system settings, macOS.)

There's no configuration for this mod. All you need is SMAPI and then to copy it into your mods folder. It's tested in Stardew Valley 1.6.14, and will hopefully work in later versions as well.
